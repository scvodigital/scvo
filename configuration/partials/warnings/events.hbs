          We continue to operate during these uncertain times and remain able to respond to your enquiries and accept bookings for our programme of forthcoming events and training courses, so have a look at our calendar below and book your place.
          <br />
          Due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic we have taken the decision to reschedule our May and June classroom-based training courses and are working with our trainers to find alternative dates. If you have signed up for one of these courses we will contact you with updated information as soon as we can. Please note more Autumn classroom-based training courses will be added and open for bookings soon.
